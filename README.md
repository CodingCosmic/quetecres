# Quetecres

Quetecres is a 2D visualization project that showcases the beauty of quantum qubits entangled in photons, influenced by live audio input. Utilizing p5.js and Web Audio API, it transforms microphone audio into captivating particle movements. Ideal for exploring the intersection of quantum physics and interactive art.

## Overview

Quetecres visualizes particles that represent quantum qubits. These particles move based on live audio input from your microphone, creating mesmerizing patterns that resemble sacred geometry. The project uses p5.js for the animation and the Web Audio API for audio analysis.

## Usage

1. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
